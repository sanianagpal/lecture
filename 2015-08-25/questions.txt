## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

Assumptions:
(1). There are m students in each row (and n rows), total students therefore = n*m
(2). Time to start the process = alpha for both serial and parallel methods. (However, in actual this value for serial method will definitely be less than parallel, but for simplicity let's assume they are same.)
(3). Time taken for gathering each count is constant = beta.
(4). Time taken for every arithmetic addition is constant = gamma.
(5). In serial method, the instructor himself counts. Hence, time to gather count = 0


1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
Time to start the process = alpha
No. of rows = n
No. of students in each row = m (atmost)
Time for the instructor to gather one count = beta, total time for gathering counts = n * beta
Time taken for one arithmentic addition = gamma, total time for arithmetic = (n-1) * gamma ~ n * gamma

Since m is the maximum count in a row,
if n students are parallely counting students in a row,
the worst case is the total time taken which m in this case.
Total time to compute row counts = m 

Total time taken = alpha + m + n * (beta + gamma)


2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
Time to start the process = alpha
Let's assume there are (atmost)m students in each row and there are n rows,
so the worst case would be m students in each row and total n*m students

Time to count the number of students = n * m
Total time taken = n*m + alpha


3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?
For parallel method to take lesser time:
alpha + m + n * (beta + gamma) < n*m + alpha
n * (beta + gamma) < (n-1) * m
m * (n-1)/n > (beta+gamma)              ---(considering n-1 ~ n)
=> m > (beta+gamma)
Therefore, for the parallel method to be faster,
number of students in each row should be more than the combined time to gather a single count and doing one arithmetic addition
